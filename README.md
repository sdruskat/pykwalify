# pykwalifire

**pykwalifire** is a fork of the YAML/JSON validation library [pykwalify](https://github.com/Grokzen/pykwalify).
It adds the following features.

## New features

### Specify custom file extensions for YAML and JSON data files

In order to be able to validate JSON or YAML files with non-default file extensions, 
the following two options have been introduced:

- `-y EXT, --yaml-extension EXT` to specify a custom extension `EXT`, allowing to
validate YAML files such as *my-yaml-file.yext*.
- `-j EXT, --json-extension EXT` to specify a custom extension `EXT`, allowing to
validate JSON files such as *my-json-file.jext*.

## History

Cf. [pykwalify](https://github.com/Grokzen/pykwalify).

# Basic usage

Create a data file. JSON and YAML formats are both supported.

```yaml
- foo
- bar
```

Create a schema file with validation rules.

```yaml
type: seq
sequence:
  - type: str
```

Validate the file from the command line:

```bash
pykwalifire -d data.yaml -s schema.yaml
```

If the YAML data file would be called *data.customextension*, you would validate it
with

```bash
pykwalifire -d data.customextension -s schema.yaml -y customextension
```

The [`pykwalify` branch](https://github.com/sdruskat/pykwalifire/tree/pykwalify)
is used to create pull requests against the [upstream repository](https://github.com/Grokzen/pykwalify).
Hopefully this way all work that's been done in *pykwalifire* can be contributed
back to the original project.
